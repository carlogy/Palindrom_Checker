# Palindrome_Checker
This is a plaindrom checker I wrote to solve the first challege for the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification 

I manipulated the string and then converted it into an array.  
I stored a reversed version in const without mutating the original, and then converted them into strings to compare original to reverse.
